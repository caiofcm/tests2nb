# PY2NB: Python To Notebook Converter

This is a small utility for turning python scripts into Jupyter notebooks and
convert module-level multi-line (triple quoted) string literals into Markdown
cells. 

## Why?

I wanted a tool to create user examples that can be executed as normal python
scripts so that they can be copy-and-pasted easily and can be rendered as
notebook for better readability (e.g., nice styling, results embedded).

Also,

* Notebooks are nice to look at but slow to write; and
* They do not play well with version control.


## Install

Install using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/caiofcm/tests2nb.git
```

Alternatively, you can create a local clone of this repository and install
from it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caiofcm/tests2nb.git
pip install py2nb/
```

## Usage


To convert a python test script into a notebook:

```bash

to do...
```

## Samples

See `tests` directory.
